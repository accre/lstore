LStore Release Tools
==============================================
 
Structure
-----------------------------------------------
* build          - Location where all sources are built
  * logs         - Build logs
  * package      - Storage with built RPMs
  * repo         - Default YUM/APT repositories
  * local        - Installation path for packages built with build-*.sh
  * ccache       - Default ccache location for docker builds
* cmake          - Additional CMake modules
* debian         - Configurations for dpkg-buildpackage
* doc            - Documentation source
* scripts        - Build scripts
  * docker       - Cached Dockerfiles
    * builder    - Bare images with only LStore dependencies and build tools
                   installed
    * buildslave - Larger image with a number of developer tools 
* src            - Source repositories
* test           - Test, benchmark, fuzz harness and cases
* vendor         - External dependencies

Dependencies
----------------------------------------------
You will need to bring your own copies of:

* openssl-devel
* czmq-devel
* zmq-devel
* zlib-devel
* fuse-devel

In addition, LStore has build-time dependencies on

* C, C++ compiler
* cmake

For centos, at least, these dependencies can be installed with:

```
yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
yum install cmake openssl-devel czmq-devel zmq-devel zlib-devel fuse-devel
```

If the local CMake installation is too old, we install a local copy into build/

Building
----------------------------------------------
LStore uses CMake as its meta build system. To initialize the build system,
execute:
```
cd build
cmake ..
```

Once the Makefile is initialized, commonly used targets include:
* `make externals` - build any neccessary external packages
* `make all`       - build LStore libraries and binaries
* `make docs`      - build LStore documentation

Packaging LStore
----------------------------------------------
LStore uses a docker-based system for packaging LStore for various linux
distributions. In general, the packaging scripts all accept a list of
distributions on the command line. By default, each distribution will be
attempted. These base images containing external dependencies and build tools
can be bootstrapped with:

>    ./scripts/build-docker-base.sh [distribution] [distribution] ...

For each supported distribution, a docker image named `lstore/builder:DIST`
will pe produced and tagged. For instance, a base Centos 7 image will be named
`lstore/builder:centos-7`. These images can be updated by executing
`build-docker-base.sh` again.

Once the base images are installed, the current source tree can be packaged
with:

>    ./scripts/package.sh [distribution] [distribution] ...

Once `package.sh` completes, the output binaries for each distribution will be
stored in `package/<distribution>/<package>/<revision>`. The revisions are
auto-generated by a heuristic that considers the number of git commits between
the working copy and the most recent release tag.
